Their first pickup was their coaching and general staff. The Atlanta Reign decided from the very beginning that they wanted their team to represent more than just another run of the mill Overwatch League team, and this can be seen in their first pickups as an organization. Off the bat, they hired Brad &ldquo;Sephy&rdquo; Rajani, the head coach for another team in the Overwatch League, the San Francisco Shock. This was a calculated risk on their part, as Sephy has previously scouted and built rosters that have absolutely dominated the Overwatch competitive scene, such as Last Night&rsquo;s Leftovers, and more notably Selfless Esports. While these rosters were known for their absolute domination of the game at their peak, they were also known as some of the most toxic teams Overwatch Esports had ever seen until that point. Many people scoffed at this initial decision to pick up Sephy, as the San Francisco Shock&rsquo;s performance in the inaugural season of the Overwatch League was very mixed. The team also notably picked up Daniel &ldquo;dafran&rdquo; Francesca, someone Sephy had originally scouted during his time with Selfless. Dafran, while being one of the best hit-scan players in the world, was also one of the most toxic pro-players to ever touch the game. Dafran would up and throw matches if he felt his team was not listening enough to him or not performing to his liking. This pickup was also marred by fans for similar reasons to Sephy. However, this team came to their first season with something to prove, and performed arguably well for their first season as a team, placing middle of the pack once the season was done. </span></p>

      <p class="c0 c7"><span class="c3"></span></p>
      <p class="c1"><span class="c3">Within the Esports community at large, the majority of arguments end up boiling down to region vs region, whether or not Asia or Europe is better than North America, and so on. In the Atlanta Reign&rsquo;s first season, it was very established in the Overwatch League that Korean/Asian talents gave more results in competitive play, compared to rosters of North American or European teams. This lead to the majority of players in the Overwatch League being pulled from the Asian semi-pro scene; and many NA/EU players began to feel they were being looked over simply because of the region they lived in and the language they spoke. Not Atlanta Reign. They picked up exclusively NA/EU talent with one exception their first time around. It was exciting for me to see the best in my region be able to compete with the best of other regions, and it honestly makes me so happy that they were able to prove the Overwatch Esports scene wrong about how the NA/EU regions are worse as a whole than the Asian region. Because of the Atlanta Reign&rsquo;s stance on picking up regional talent and actually receiving results, many teams further adopted mixed-region rosters, rather than just stacking the deck with a full Korean team, and NA/EU talent was able to shine because of their roster decisions. </span></p>
